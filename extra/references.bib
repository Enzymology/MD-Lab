abstract = {GROMACS is an engine to perform molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimization. These are two of the many techniques that belong to the realm of computational chemistry and molecular modeling. Computational chemistry is just a name to indicate the use of computational techniques in chemistry, ranging from quantum mechanics of molecules to dynamics of large complex molecular aggregates. Molecular modeling indicates the general process of describing complex chemical systems in terms of a realistic atomic model, with the goal being to under- stand and predict macroscopic properties based on detailed knowledge on an atomic scale. Often, molecular modeling is used to design new materials, for which the accurate prediction of physical properties of realistic systems is required.},
